"""
Event Deduplication Service

Prevents creating duplicate events for ongoing violations.
Only creates new events when:
- A new violation starts (person was compliant, now has violations)
- The violation type changes significantly (different PPE items or actions)
- A violation ends (person becomes compliant)

Updates existing events when violations end with end_frame and duration.

Improved logic:
- Tracks PPE and action violations separately
- Merges them into a single event per person
- Handles transitions smoothly without creating duplicates
